## Hi there, world! 👋

👨 Pronouns: He/Him/His

👨‍💻 I'm a Web Development student on his second (and final) year. Eager to learn about more language but at my own pace. I have also learned to create a server with Docker and Microsoft Azure and to create a virtual machines for that. As of right now, I'm kind of more proficient in HTML and PHP than the other languages.

You **may** or **may not** fork my public repositories. But please, do **contribute** to any of them. I'll gladly accept corrections as well as some help. After all, failure is the best way to learn, right?

## **Languages**

## **Tools**
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker,git,github,idea,notion,vscode,linux,ubuntu,windows&perline=3)](https://skillicons.dev)

🧐 I'm looking for help in Java, CSS, MySQL, and JavaScript.
